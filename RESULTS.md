## Key Insights

### Cross-Domain Performance

The enhanced reranker performs well across different query types:

**Tax Lawyer (Legal Domain):**
- Moderate difficulty - many lawyers, but few tax specialists
- Hard filtering removed 16% of candidates
- Soft scores: 4.1-5.25/10 (room for improvement)

**Banker (Finance Domain):**
- High performance - strong candidate pool
- No hard filtering needed (all qualified)
- Soft scores: 7.6-9.2/10 (excellent matching)

### System Strengths

1. **Hard Criteria Filtering**: Effectively removes unqualified candidates
2. **Keyword Extraction**: Identifies domain-specific terms (IRS, M&A, etc.)
3. **Multi-Field Scoring**: Checks summary, experience, titles, companies
4. **Cross-Domain Adaptability**: Works well for both legal and finance queries

### Areas for Future Improvement

1. **Query-Specific Tuning**:
   - Tax lawyer queries need stronger emphasis on specific experience
   - Could boost scores for exact matches (e.g., "IRS audit" > "audit")

2. **Synonym Expansion**:
   - "M&A" ↔ "mergers and acquisitions"
   - "JD" ↔ "Juris Doctor" ↔ "Doctor of Law"

3. **Domain Knowledge**:
   - Healthcare banking: already excellent (85.3/100 avg)
   - Tax law: needs refinement (48.5/100 avg)

4. **Embedding Quality**:
   - Consider fine-tuning embeddings on legal/finance domains
   - Or use domain-specific models
